## Space Jams

* Skyler Hanson (swh65)
* Kyler Carling (kjc472)
* Robert Bednarek (rab587)

## Instructions

In Space Jams, you control a record that bounces along musical platforms, trying to "jam" for as long as possible. The record can jump by pressing the space bar, and additional notes
 may be placed by pressing the "Q", "W", and "E" keys, though each note can only be placed once every 5 seconds.

## Known Bugs or Issues

Ocassional physics issues; double jumps sometimes fail to counterract falling momentum. Additionally, climbing up the side of a note block may cause the player to receive a 
massive boost upward, though a low ceiling just offscreen prevents this from being too much of a problem.

## Credits

* Skyler Hanson: Created sprites for splash screen, player character, and background. Added logic to play sounds when colliding with note blocks, and created background music.
* Kyler Carling: Created note block sprites. Added physics and player note block placement. Added automatically generating note blocks.
* Robert Bednarek: Created sprites for title screen and lose screen. Created note sounds, made notes fade out when collision ends.
